# Zone plans

When creating or updating a [zone plan](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-subscription-properties), Partners can use one of the following values for the `id` of the `rate_plan` field (which controls the zone-level plan subscription).

- `"PARTNERS_FREE"`
- `"PARTNERS_PRO"`
- `"PARTNERS_BIZ"`
- `"PARTNERS_ENT"`

The values available to Partners are based on their reseller agreement.
